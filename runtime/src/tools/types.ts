// ToolDef / ToolObservation — the tool interface contract (ADR-001 Decision 5).
//
// Every tool is a module implementing a fixed interface. The LOOP, not the tool,
// calls the gate: a tool DECLARES its `capability` and `actionTier` statically
// (what makes the trace assertion and grant intersection mechanical) but never
// decides whether it may run. By the time `execute()` is called, the loop has
// already guaranteed a gate-permit (Decision 5: "pure of governance").
//
// "Pure of governance" is NOT "pure of confinement reality": a path-bearing
// write/delete tool still owns the filesystem open-once TOCTOU rule (Decision
// 2a.4) inside its own `execute()`. To re-assert containment on the opened
// object WITHOUT re-deriving the root, `execute()` is handed the run's
// `WorkspaceBoundary` via `ToolExecContext` (the §3 confinement↔app seam).
//
// Decoupling: no `electron`, no app imports.
